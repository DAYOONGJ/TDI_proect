#### Problem: 

In this day and age, people tend to eat outside or buy more prepared foods because of its convenience. However, we all know cooking meals ourselves is healthier, and healthy eating plays a critical role in our daily well-being. It is indispensable in preventing and managing conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer, and so on. 

###### There are many benefits to cooking at home! 

- First, it is healthier. I can control what I put into food and exactly know how fresh the ingredients are. When we eat outside, we do not know how long it has been in the restaurant, and also the restaurant can manipulate the scent of it so that we the customer cannot tell if it has gone bad. Also, I can easily manage the portions I will eat by design. 

- Second, it is cheaper. According to the Forbes, It is almost five times more expensive to order delivery from a restaurant than it is to cook at home. And if you’re using a meal kit service as a shortcut to a home cooked meal, still almost three times as expensive as cooking from scratch.
	
- Third, it is friendlier to the environment. We do not need to wasted takeaway food boxes which are destroying our environment. Single use plastics are a major concern for the planet.

Despite all the benefits of cooking, it is a hassle washing dishes or looking for recipes as a beginner. Thus, I would like to create a personalized meal & recipe recommender system to suggest meal & recipe that cater to the individuals’ mood and health goals, and help users develop healthy eating behavior by following the recommendations.
